              We promote a respectful, conversation-based adoption program that strives to:
     1.) provide exceptional guest services; educate prospective adopters;
     2.) assist in matching people with a pet who best suits their lifestyle expectations.

We ensure all pets receive special care and service. Each pet entering our shelters receives a examination by our professionally trained staff members.

We make every attempt to determine if an animal has any medical conditions while in our care.

All pets available for adoption are considered healthy/treatable and manageable/treatable and capable of being rehabilitated.

We collect adoption fees to assist in the daily care and on-going needs of each pet admitted to SDHS.

“Love your new pet...or let us know. We're committed to finding adopters their best pet match.”
